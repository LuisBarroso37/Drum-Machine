# Drum Machine
Drum Machine Project - freeCodeCamp

In this project I made a drum machine. You can click on the buttons or use the corresponding keys to play sounds.

Initially the machine is turned off so you have to turn it on.
You can change the volume and change the set of sounds you want to use.
In the display you can see the name of the sound you are playing.

Things I learnt:
- How to use vanilla Javascript to make a more complex project
